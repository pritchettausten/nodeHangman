User is prompted to pick Start New Game or Exit.
When new game starts, a random country from countries.txt is selected.
The country is then split into an array of letters and each of those letters is printed out as a underscore.
When the user selects a letter, it is compared to each letter in the array and printed out if it is there.
Once the user guesses the final letter it is complete and they are presented the option to start a new game or exit again.
